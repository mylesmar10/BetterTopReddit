# BetterTopReddit
Chrome extension - Adds more advanced sorting for Reddit Top posts, such as 'past X days'.

Ever miss out on your favorite subreddit for 3 or 4 days and want to catch up on the top posts?  This extension lets you view top posts from a specific amount of days back instead of the default 'one week'.
